# CLAUDE.md — Clue Project Context

> **Session continuity instruction:** When your context window is approaching its limit (~60%), save any new decisions, discoveries, or structural changes back into this file before they are lost. Update the relevant section rather than appending blindly. Also update docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md and tick completed items in docs/roadmap.md. Do not wait to be reminded. This file is the single source of truth across all sessions.

## What Is Clue

Clue is a crowdsourced indoor localization system built by a solo engineer as a side project.

Users contribute motion trajectories, raw sensor recordings, and indoor markers. The system learns indoor layouts over time and lets users locate items and points of interest inside buildings.

Examples: find milk in a supermarket, Gate B12 in an airport, a shop in a mall, a conference room in an office.

Target localization accuracy: **2–5 meters**. Perfect positioning is not required.

---

## Core Philosophy

Always prioritize in this order:

1. Data collection
2. Visualization
3. Reproducibility
4. Simplicity

Before AI, machine learning, or optimization.

Never introduce machine learning until data collection, replay, visualization, and a baseline implementation exist.

## Current State (as of 2026-06-18)

**Current phase:** Phase 0 complete → **Phase 1 (Sensor Logger) starting.**

### apps/mobile — map/home prototype

Runs on device (Pixel 6, Android 16). Uses `flutter_map` with OSM tiles.

| File | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `lib/main.dart` | Entry point |
| `lib/services/router.dart` | go_router, home + map routes |
| `lib/pages/home_page.dart` | Homepage placeholder |
| `lib/pages/map_page.dart` | Map page |
| `lib/components/navbar_component.dart` | Bottom nav |
| `lib/components/map_component.dart` | flutter_map with geolocator |

Dependencies: `go_router`, `flutter_map`, `latlong2`, `permission_handler`, `geolocator`, `flutter_svg`

Note: `maplibre_gl` was replaced with `flutter_map` — maplibre_gl 0.20.0 uses the removed Flutter v1 Android embedding API and fails to build on current SDKs.

### apps/mobile.v0 — Clue SL sensor logger (active)

Package: `clue_sl` · Org: `com.clue` · Android + iOS only

| File | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `lib/main.dart` | Entry point → ClueApp |
| `lib/app.dart` | MaterialApp.router + GoRouter + bottom nav shell |
| `lib/features/logger/logger_page.dart` | Placeholder (sensor recording) |
| `lib/features/sessions/sessions_page.dart` | Placeholder (session browser) |
| `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` | Location + BLE permissions declared |

Dependencies: `go_router`, `sensors_plus`, `flutter_blue_plus`, `path_provider`

### Infrastructure

- Mono-repo structure in place: `apps/`, `crates/`, `backend/`, `data/`
- No Rust code yet
- No backend yet
- No database yet
- No CI yet

## Development Phases

| Phase | Name | Duration | Status |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| 0 | Project Setup | 1 week | **Done** |
| 1 | Sensor Logger | 2 weeks | **In progress** |
| 2 | Replay System | 2 weeks | Not started |
| 3 | Dead Reckoning | 4 weeks | Not started |
| 4 | Indoor Visualization | 2 weeks | Not started |
| 5 | Collaborative Mapping | 4 weeks | Not started |
| 6 | Item Tagging | 4 weeks | Not started |
| 7 | Fingerprinting | 4 weeks | Not started |
| 8 | Advanced Localization | 4 weeks | Not started |

**First milestone:** A deployed app that records sensor sessions, uploads them, and replays them.

## Data Pipeline

```
Raw Sensors → Features → Trajectories → Indoor Graph → Localization → Item Discovery
```

---

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Mobile | Flutter (Android + iOS) |
| Shared core | Rust (FFI into Flutter) |
| Backend | Rust + Axum + Tokio |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Object storage | Cloudflare R2 or Hetzner local |
| Hosting | Hetzner Cloud (~€8/month) |

Budget constraint: **€15/month**, max €250/year.

## Sensor Logger (Phase 1) — Target Deliverables

Working from `apps/mobile.v0` (package `clue_sl`):

- Accelerometer recording
- Gyroscope recording
- Magnetometer recording
- BLE scanning
- Session recording (start / stop / persist locally)

---

## Key Decisions

- `maplibre_gl` dropped in favour of `flutter_map` (v1 Android embedding incompatibility)
- Sensor logger lives in `apps/mobile.v0` (separate app from the map prototype in `apps/mobile`)
- `sensors_plus` chosen for IMU; `flutter_blue_plus` for BLE
- Local session format still undecided (SQLite vs flat files vs protobuf)
- Barometer and Wi-Fi scanning not in Clue SL milestone scope

---

## Rules

### Always

- Prefer the smallest working solution
- Small commits, incremental delivery
- Testable components
- Preserve all raw sensor data — never delete originals
- Store raw recordings separately from processed outputs
- Visualize data before proposing new algorithms
- Keep infrastructure under €20/month

### Never (until 100+ sessions exist and replay + mapping work)

- User accounts / social features / gamification
- Deep learning / recommendation systems
- Distributed systems
- Premature optimization

### Rust standards

- Strong typing, small modules, unit tests
- No global mutable state, no large files, no complex abstractions

### Flutter standards

- Feature-based folder structure (`features/<name>/`)
- Stateless widgets where possible
- Clear UI / business logic separation

---

## ML Progression (when the time comes)

1. Rules → 2. Statistics → 3. kNN → 4. HMM → 5. Particle filters → 6. Deep learning
